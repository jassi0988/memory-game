# memory-game
Test your memory with this memory game. On the game board, there are always two identical images. Start the game by flipping a card. Then try to find another card that has the same image as the first. If you can't find a pair, the flipped cards will be flipped back with the face down. Try to remember these images as it becomes easier to find pairs the longer you play.
